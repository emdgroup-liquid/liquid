The typography globals consist of CSS custom properties, which you can use to either apply a `font-familily` or a `font` value, using a combination of `font-size`, `line-height` and `font-familily`.

In most cases you will probably want to simply use components though, which themselves make use of global typography CSS custom properties, such as the [`ld-heading`](/components/ld-heading/) component.
