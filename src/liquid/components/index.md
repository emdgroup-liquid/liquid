# Components

Liquid's components allow you to quickly construct the UI of your app.

If you do not find a component that you need within Liquid, it may be because it has not been implemented yet. In that case it is either already listed in our [enhancement backlog](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues?q=sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Afeature), and you can upvote or comment on the respective issue, or it has not been added to the backlog yet, and you can [create a feature request](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) yourself.

## Enhancement backlog

We manage our [enhancement backlog on GitHub](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues?q=sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Afeature) and prioritise issues based on upvotes. Upvote the top comment of an issue with üëç if you want the enhancement to be prioritised higher.

## Submitting an enhancement request

If you have a suggestion for a new component not listed here or would like to suggest en enhancement to an existing component, you can create an [enhancement request on GitHub](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Please read our [contributing guidelines on submitting enhancements](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-enhancements) before submitting your first request.
