# Contributing

First off, thanks for considering making a contribution to Liquid Oxygen! üëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Liquid Oxygen.
These are not rules. So use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of conduct

This project and everyone who participates in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct][code of conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [liquid@emdgroup.com](liquid@emdgroup.com).

## Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Liquid. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report ‚úèÔ∏è, reproduce the behavior üíªüíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you do not need to create one. Fill out [our bug report template][bug report template] and include as many details as possible. The more information we have, the more likely we will be able to resolve the issue in a short time.

<ld-notice mode="warning">
  If you find a <strong>closed</strong> issue that seems like it is describing the same thing that you are experiencing, please open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. <strong>Please do not comment on closed issues.</strong> Instead, create a new bug report issue. If you prefer to discuss with others before, you can start a discussion on <a href="https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/discussions">GitHub discussions</a> or our <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ab5381a933c6c413ea0ae41c3b424acd8%40thread.skype/Liquid%2520Design%2520System?groupId=babb6c18-c13f-43ef-baf2-ce1617f228cd&tenantId=db76fb59-a377-4120-bc54-59dead7d39c9">Teams channel</a>.
</ld-notice>

### Before submitting a bug report

* Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem **in the latest version of Liquid**.
* **Perform a search in [existing issues](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, upvote the issue report or add a comment to the existing issue, if you think it contains relevant information which will help resolve it, instead of opening a new one.

### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template][bug report template].

**Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:**

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

**Provide more context by answering these questions:**

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Liquid)?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Liquid?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

**Include details about your configuration and environment:**

* **Which version of Liquid are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `npm list @emdgroup-liquid/liquid` inside the working directory of your project.
* **Which browser are you using?**
* **Which browser extensions are installed? Can you reproduce the issue in incognito mode?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which other framework/libraries are you using that may be involved in the issue?** Please check https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview for possible known quirks.

## Requesting new features

This section guides you through submitting a feature request for Liquid, including completely new components, new features to existing components and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your request ‚úèÔ∏è and find related requests üîé.

### Before submitting a feature request

- Most importantly, check if you are using **the latest version of Liquid**.
- **Perform a search in the [feature backlog]** to see if a similar feature has already been requested. If it has and the issue is still open or if it has the **needed: votes** label, upvote the requested feature or add a comment, if you think it contains relevant information that will help drive it forward, instead of opening a new one. If you prefer to discuss with others first, you can start a discussion on [GitHub discussions][discussions] or in our [Teams channel][teams].

### How do I vote on an existing feature request?

You can upvote a feature request, if it has the `needed: votes` label, with a üëç reaction on the top comment of the issue. The more votes, the higher we prioritize the request.

### How do I submit a (good) feature request?

Feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Use our [feature request template] to create a feature request and include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a detailed description of the requested feature**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate how the feature works**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **List some other UI libraries or applications where this feature already exists.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** of similar features implemented in other UI libraries or applications, to help demonstrate what you expect from the feature. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most Liquid Oxygen users and why it is not something that can or should be implemented as a separate community package.
* **Specify which version of Liquid you are using.** You can get the exact version by running `npm list @emdgroup-liquid/liquid` inside the working directory of your project.
* **Specify the name and version of the browser you are using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you are using.**

## Contributing code

Unsure where to begin contributing to Liquid Oxygen? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues?q=label%3Abeginner+-label%3Adone+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+is%3Aopen) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/issues?q=label%3A"help+wanted"+-label%3Adone+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+is%3Aopen) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable indicator for the impact your contribution can have.

### Local development

Before you can contribute any code, you will most likely want to setup a local development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

2. Clone the project (or your fork of it):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:emdgroup-liquid/liquid.git
```

3. Install dependencies inside the project folder:

```sh
corepack enable && pnpm i
```

4. Trigger the generation of type definitions within the `src/liquid` folder by running the project build task (this step is only required before starting the local dev server for the first time):

```sh
pnpm run build
```

5. Start up the local development server:

```sh
pnpm run start
```

6. Now head over to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - you shoud see the Liquid docs site.

```

As you can see, Liquid Oxygen currenly has a straight forward project structure:
One repo, one package.json, no workspaces, just two main directories inside the `src/` folder, `src/docs/` for the docs site and `src/liquid/` for the component library.

### Conventions

#### Code style

You probably noticed by now that we use [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) in this project to enforce some code style conventions. Please make sure to enable these tools in your code editor of choice.

Some things are not linted but are still important:

- We prefix Liquid components with `ld-` and docs components with `docs-`.
- We use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) as a methodology for organizing CSS rules.
- We use relative length units in CSS, mostly `rem`; absolute length units should be avoided (borders and outlines may count as an exception to the rule).
- We use Shadow DOM wherever possible, especially in components which use slots: not using Shadow DOM in such components resutls in a worse performance (due to Stencil&apos;s custom _slot_ implementation performing expensive DOM operations) and quirks in React apps. We allow for custom styling of Web Component by applying [part](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) attributes to component internal elements and using component specific CSS custom properties where applicable.
- When ever possible, try to provide CSS Components alongside WebComponents using the same CSS file; prefix CSS classes with `ld-` and use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).
- Stylesheet files of WebComponents which have no CSS Component counterpart must include a `.shadow` suffix in the file name (for instance `ld-sidenav.shadow.css`). This will ensure the CSS does not end up in the CSS components bundle.
- When writing CSS, we follow common best practices. We try to keep the CSS specificity to a minimum, in order to simplify component customization, but we also make sure that it is not low to an extent, where styles get overwritten by other librariesapos; reset or normalize styles (such as Tailwindapos;s [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)). In other words: If you are using the CSS `:where` trick to reduce CSS speceficity to zero, make sure the properties affected are not potential candidates for reset and normalize styles.
- Due to an issue in Stencil, type declarations need to be either inlined or exported, as otherwise undefined types end up in the generated components.d.ts file.
- A lists of all labels we use in order to help us track and manage issues and pull requests can be found [here](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/labels).

We also use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for running Git hooks which in turn run lint tasks
before you commit or push something. Which brings us to the next point...

#### Commit messages

Commit messages are linted with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) and should adhere to
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This ensures that
[semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io), which we use for automated release management,
works as it is supposed to. Please [squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing) which together solve a specific task before submitting a pull request. This not only ensures a clean Git history, but also a clean changelog which is generated by semantic release automatically upon release.
#### Branch names

Branch names are linted using the following regular expression before push:

```sh
^((feat|fix|hotfix|build|chore|ci|docs|style|refactor|perf|test)\/([a-z0-9._-]+)|main|rc)$
```

### How to run tests

There are multiple commands available as npm scripts for running different kinds of tests:
Unit tests, functional (e2e) tests as well as visual regression tests (using screenshots) are [handled by Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/testing-overview). We also run accessibility tests within the functional test suits using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

<ld-notice mode="warning">
  <b>Automated accessibility testing</b> helps comply with accessibility guidelines but <strong>does not guarantee that a website or app is accessible</strong>. You still need to perform manual testing using screen readers and involve users with disabilities in user testings.
</ld-notice>

You execute tests either by running one of the npm scripts which start with `test` (see package.json) or by executing the respective test commands directly with the options needed. Please refer to the docs of each test runner in question for available options.

The following examples should help you start testing quickly and efficiently.

#### Run all unit tests with coverage:

```sh
pnpm run test:unit
```

#### Run all unit tests in watch mode:

```sh
pnpm run test:watch
```

#### Run unit tests for the `ld-tabs` component in watch mode with coverage:

```sh
stencil test --spec --coverage --no-cache --watch=all -- ld-tabs ld-tablist
```

#### Run all end-to-end tests:

```sh
pnpm run test:e2e
```

#### Run end-to-end tests for the `ld-sidenav` component:

```sh
stencil test --screenshot --e2e -- src/liquid/components/ld-sidenav/test/ld-sidenav.e2e.ts && pnpm run test:e2e:cleanup
```

#### Compare visual regression testing screenshots of failed end-to-end tests:

```sh
pnpm run test:compare_screenshots
```

#### Delete all visual regression testing screenshots for the `ld-sidenav` component:

```sh
ts-node scripts/screenshots.ts rm -c ld-sidenav
```

### Pull requests

When you have implemented changes in your local clone or fork of our Liquid Oxygen repository, it is time to create a pull request in order to integrate these changes. But before you do that, please follow these steps to make sure your contribution gets considered by the Liquid Oxygen maintainers:

1. Be sure you follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/emdgroup-liquid/liquid/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md).
2. Be sure you follow the [project conventions](./#conventions).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
