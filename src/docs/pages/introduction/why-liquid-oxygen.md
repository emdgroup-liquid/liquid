# Why Liquid Oxygen

We are working hard to make Liquid Oxygen a reliable and easy to use component library. These are the values we provide:

## 1. Design Compliance

All Liquid Oxygen components follow the Liquid Design Guidelines and are build in close coorperation with the Liquid Design Team. Therefore, Liquid Oxygen is the easiest way to make sure your project is compliant with the Liquid Design System.

## 2. Accessability

Making sure everyone can use our applications is a core value of Liquid Oxygen. Therefore all components are built with accessibility in mind, following best practices by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level AA requirements.

## 3. Choose your own tech stack

We use [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) to build Liquid Oxygen. It ships standards-based Web Components and CSS Components, which you can include in almost any modern web-based tech stack. Liquid Oxygen also provides bindings for relevant libraries like React to improve the developer experience.

## 4. Documentation

A well-written and complete documentation is essential to a project. It is a pre-condition for trial, usage, maintenance and adoption. Therefore, we put a lot of effort into maintaining an up-to-date and in-depth documentation and fostering a feedback and collaboration culture around it.

## 5. Typescript

Liquid Oxygen uses Typescript. Therefore it comes with type definitions that allow type checking and intellisense in your project (currently supported in TSX and plain HTML only). It also facilitates maintenance and favors code contributions by ensuring type safety when refactoring code or fixing bugs.

## 6. Small footprint

Import only what you need, leverage tree-shaking or use lightweight CSS Components â€“ all of this is possible with Liquid Oxygen. This helps you to keep your bundle size small and your application fast.
